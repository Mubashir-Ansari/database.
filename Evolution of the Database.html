	<p1>Databases have evolved dramatically since their inception within the early 1960s. Navigational databases like the hierarchical database (which relied on a tree-like model and allowed only a one-to-many relationship), and therefore the network database (a more flexible model that allowed multiple relationships), were the initial systems wont to store and manipulate data. Although simple, these early systems were inflexible. within the 1980s, relational databases became popular, followed by object-oriented databases within the 1990s. More recently, NoSQL databases passed as a response to the expansion of the web and therefore the need for faster speed and processing of unstructured data. Today, cloud databases and self-driving databases are breaking new ground when it involves how data is collected, stored, managed, and utilized.<p1/>
