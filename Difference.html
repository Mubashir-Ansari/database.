<p1>Databases and spreadsheets (such as Microsoft Excel) are both convenient ways to store information. the first differences between the 2 are:</p1>

    <P1>How the info is stored and manipulated</p1>
    <p1>Who can access the info</p1>
    <p1>what proportion data are often stored</p1>

<p1>Spreadsheets were originally designed for one user, and their characteristics reflect that. Theyíre great for one user or small number of users who donít have to do lots of incredibly complicated data manipulation. Databases, on the opposite hand, are designed to carry much larger collections of organized informationómassive amounts, sometimes. Databases allow multiple users at the identical time to quickly and securely access and query the info using highly complex logic and language.</p1>
